# 📘 LeetCode Solutions – DSA Journey

## 👋 Overview
This repository documents my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** learning journey through LeetCode problems.  
The focus here is **deep understanding**, not rote memorization.

**Each solution reflects:**
- 🧩 Clear problem understanding
- ⚙️ Correct use of patterns (Stack, BFS/DFS, Sliding Window, Binary Search, Recursion, etc.)
- ⚡ Optimized time and space complexity
- 🧠 Learnings that transfer to real-world engineering and ML systems

## 🎯 Why This Repository Exists
My long-term goal is to work in:
* **Machine Learning / AI**
* **Software Engineering**
* **System Design & Optimization**

**Strong DSA skills help me:**
* Reason about performance in ML pipelines.
* Optimize data preprocessing and model execution.
* Write scalable, efficient code.
* Succeed in technical interviews.

*This repo is my foundation for all of that.*

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy
* **Concepts > Speed:** I prioritize understanding the *why* over just getting the green checkmark.
* **Root Cause Analysis:** I identify why naive solutions fail.
* **First Principles:** I focus on invariants, patterns, and trade-offs.
* **Repetition:** I revisit problems until the logic feels natural.

> *"Confusion is part of learning — clarity is the goal."*
